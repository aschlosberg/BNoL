BNoL (*pron. bee-noll*) is a Python library for discrete feature selection with a primary focus on transcriptomic (gene-expression) analysis. Within transcriptomics there is a need for discovery of specific features (biomarkers) rather than weighted combinations as can be found through feature extraction methods such as PCA.

Although documented and tested, the code is very much in its infancy and function interfaces are open to change. Unit tests are currently focussed on sanity (e.g. dimensions of matrices / vectors) and very simple hand-worked expected results.

BNoL stands for *Bare Necessities of Life*, inspired by the line in the Jungle Book song: "Old Mother Nature's recipes; that bring the bare necessities of life".
